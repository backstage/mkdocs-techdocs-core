# The following are something akin to peer dependencies. They are represented
# as ranges in order to support interoperability with other mkdocs plugins or
# packages that might otherwise exist in an adopter's environment.
mkdocs>=1.2.2
Markdown>=3.2,<3.4

# The following are more akin to direct dependencies. Each line represents one
# or more features that are provided by `techdocs-core`, and thus are always
# pinned to an exact version. Bumps should be accompanied by release notes
# explaining what was added or fixed (or at least pointing to the underlying
# release notes of the bumped package).
mkdocs-material==9.1.3
mkdocs-monorepo-plugin==1.0.4
plantuml-markdown==3.5.1
markdown_inline_graphviz_extension==1.1.1
mdx_truly_sane_lists==1.3
pygments==2.14
pymdown-extensions==10.0

# The following are temporary dependencies that are only necessary to work
# around incompatible/conflicting underlying dependencies. Each dependency
# should include a comment explaining why it is needed, and under what
# circumstances it can be removed in the future.
